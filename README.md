## DS--Evaluation-1 (Part 2 - Bonus Questions and App deployment description)
1.

- The problem that I came across was not naive conceptually, as my seniors and other authors have implemented different techniques to get the desired results. But for me, the challenge was I had to process extensive data and use a machine-learning algorithm to predict the output.

- In this problem, I used the Clustering algorithm to classify the 'Hillslope' area and a river channel. As a result of this, I could get accurate results, and my project is called the 'Excellent Criteria ' in terms of my work. Moreover, my work has been highly appreciated by My senior's. So, I consider this a topic/area where I did some work that was never done before using Machine Learning.

2.
Given : V' is a vector subspace of vector space V.

Now, 

from the property of vector space,Each member of the vector space must have a unique additive space.

Therefore,(0,0) must be a part of the vector space. This, is possible in option three i.e (a,2a)

App Deployment Steps:

1. Used EDA techniques like data wrangling, data visualization to understand the relation-ship between different features. This gave idea users experience towards app using ratings.
2. Use NLP libraries for text data analysis ex: Here, I used sentiments analysis.
3. Different text data have been prossesed and their compound score is calculated.
4. Then,this score is filtered w.r.t to user rating.
5. Finally,we got incorrect ratind data.
6. For model,I have used streamlit library and Spyder as an IDE.Initially we have created app interface using user input features like ID and Star.
7. I have also given access to CSV file as input and finally we dropped few feature which are not relevant to the analysis.
8. I created user interface for login and account creation.
9. For security purpose I used hashlib library,also I did use sqlite for database management.
10.Finally, I saved all the files in github repositories and deployed the model through github.
